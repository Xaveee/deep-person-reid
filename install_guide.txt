First make sure that python is installed: https://www.python.org/
Make sure to tick "Add to PATH" box

1. Create an empty folder to clone git
2. Open that folder in VScode
3. Open termimal (make sure it's a command prompt and not a powershell) and enter 'git clone https://github.com/Xaveee/deep-person-reid.git'
4. CLOSE the current folder and open the one you just clone (deep-person-reid)

## IMPORTANT: Make sure that you have deativated any conda environment. We dont want to install to the wrong environment

## Create virtual environment
5. Open the terminal (make sure it's a command prompt and not a powershell) and type 'py -m venv venv'
## Install packages
6. First activate the virtual environment by entering into the terminal '.\venv\scripts\activate'. You should see the '(venv)' at the beginning of your working folder
7. Change your python interpreter. Press 'Ctrl + Shift + P'. Look for 'Python: select interpreter'. Select 'enter interpreter path'. Select 'venv\scripts\python.exe'. Now you should see that you are using the venv interpreter in the bottom left corner
8. Install all packages by typing into the termimal 'pip install -r requirements.txt'
## Install torch. 
9. Type in the termimal 'pip3 install torch==1.10.0+cu113 torchvision==0.11.1+cu113 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu113/torch_stable.html'
10. Type in the termimal 'python setup.py develop'

## Running the program
11. type in termimal 'cd ssd_mobilenet_v3' to change the working directory
12. To change the number of cameras in the camera network. Go to "ssd_mobilenet_v3\re-id.py" and change cam_num (line 15) value.
13. Use 'python re-id.py' to run (the virtual must be activated for the program to run). The time it takes to boot up depending on the processor of the computer.
14. To deativate, just type deactivate to the terminal


## Notes
Because of a bug in our program, in order to have the visualization saved, there must be a person present on the camera CONSECUTIVELY for at least 20 seconds.

To view the results, you can either use the .csv file labeled_gal.csv in "ssd_mobilenet_v3\data\labeled_gal.csv" or go to visualization folder in "ssd_mobilenet_v3\data\visualization". Each numbered folder is the label for each person identified.
